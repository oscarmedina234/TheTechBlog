# TheTechBlog

## Description

This app is supposed to be a tech blog application that uses express, node, handlebars, sequelize, sql, sessions, and bcrypt. I learned about handlebars and how to use the MVC file structure. I have all the models, schema, routes, and server set up but couldn't get the server to connect to sequelize and allow me to set up handlebars and view what was going to show up on the application. So the front end is not complete just the backend is mostly complete. 

## Installation

Make sure you install all the required dependencies with npm i in the package.json file.

## Credits

I followed the in class activities to get the boiler code and how to structure the files according the the MVC file structure. 

## License

I use the MIT License. If you want more info check out the LICENSE file in the repository.
